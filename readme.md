Temporal Flow is a decentralized content sharing platform designed for creators. It's an all-in-one hub for hosting and sharing creative content in a central location while making it easy to discover and connect with other creators.

Unlike traditional platforms that control your content on centralized servers, Temporal Flow gives you full ownership of your work with the benefits of a connected community.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with your deployment:

- ‚úÖ **Verify deployment completion**: Ensure your first deployment has fully completed
- üîÑ **Check repository name**: Confirm your repository name matches the URL path exactly
- üåê **Browser cache**: Try clearing your browser cache or opening in an incognito window
- üîç **Path issues**: If encountering 404 errors or missing assets, check relative paths in your code

## Custom Domain Setup

For setting up a custom domain, please refer to [GitHub's official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

## Important Configuration Notes
When deploying to GitHub Pages, your site will be available at <code>https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/</code>. The template should automatically configure the correct base path during deployment.

If you're having path-related issues (404 errors, missing styles/images):
1. Ensure your site's first deployment has completed successfully
2. Check that your repository name exactly matches the URL path
3. Try clearing your browser cache or opening in an incognito window
4. For custom domain setup, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
