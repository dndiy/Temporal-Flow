## What is Temporal Flow?

Temporal Flow is a decentralized content sharing platform designed for creators. It's an all-in-one hub for hosting and sharing creative content in a central location while making it easy to discover and connect with other creators.

Unlike traditional platforms that control your content on centralized servers, Temporal Flow gives you full ownership of your work with the benefits of a connected community.

</table>

### View your published site:

11. After successful deployment, go to **Settings** > **Pages**
12. Find the green banner at the top with your site URL: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Important Configuration Notes

When deploying to GitHub Pages, your site will be available at `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`. The template should automatically configure the correct base path during deployment.

If you're having path-related issues (404 errors, missing styles/images):

1. Ensure your site's first deployment has completed successfully
2. Check that your repository name exactly matches the URL path
3. Try clearing your browser cache or opening in an incognito window
4. For custom domain setup, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

## Usage

### Creating Content

Content in Temporal Flow is created using Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files in the `content` directory:

1. Create a new file in `src/content/posts/`
2. Add frontmatter at the top of the file (see Frontmatter section below)
3. Write your content in Markdown/MDX format
4. Save the file and it will automatically appear in your blog feed

### Understanding Frontmatter

Frontmatter is the YAML section at the beginning of each content file that defines metadata and behavior. Here's a breakdown of available options:

#### Basic Metadata
```yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"              # Required: Title of your post
published: 2025-03-29               # Required: Publication date
description: "Brief description"     # Recommended: Used for SEO and previews
image: "/posts/mypost/feature.jpg"   # Featured image path
tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3]            # Array of tags for categorization
category: "Main Category"           # Primary category
draft: false                        # Set to true to hide from production
lang: "en"                          # Content language code
---
```

#### Custom Author Info
```yaml
---
# Custom author override (optional)
avatarImage: "/authors/guest-avatar.png"
authorName: "Guest Author"
authorBio: "Brief author bio goes here"
---
```

#### Banner Configuration
```yaml
---
# Standard image banner
image: "/posts/mypost/banner.jpg"

# OR Video banner
bannerType: "video"
bannerData:
  videoId: "dQw4w9WgXcQ"            # YouTube video ID
  
# OR Timeline banner
bannerType: "timeline"
bannerData:
  category: "Project History"
  startYear: 2020
  endYear: 2025
  background: "/posts/timeline/background.jpg"
  height: "70vh"                    # Optional banner height
---
```

#### Timeline Integration
```yaml
---
# Timeline event data
timelineYear: 2023                  # Year for timeline placement
timelineEra: "digital-age"          # Timeline era classification
timelineLocation: "Global"          # Location for map view
isKeyEvent: true                    # Highlight as a key event
---
```

## Admin Panel

Temporal Flow features a powerful browser-based admin panel that lets you configure and manage your site without writing code.

### Accessing the Admin Panel

1. Navigate to your deployed site's `/admin` path
2. Enter your admin password to authenticate
3. You'll be presented with the main admin dashboard

### Admin Panel Sections

The admin panel is organized into several tabs for easy navigation:

- **General Settings**: Site name, subtitle, language configuration, etc.
- **Navigation**: Add, remove, and reorder navigation links
- **Profile**: Update your profile information and social media links
- **Appearance**: Light/dark mode preferences and theme customization
- **Timeline**: Configure timeline eras and display options
- **Community**: Set up Discord integration and contact forms
- **About**: Configure about page sections and team information
- **Security**: Reset admin password and configure security settings

## GitHub Integration

One of Temporal Flow's standout features is its direct GitHub repository integration, allowing you to manage your site without a local development environment.

### Setting Up GitHub Integration

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with repository access
2. In the admin panel, navigate to any configuration tab
3. Scroll down to the GitHub Integration section
4. Click "Connect to GitHub" and enter your token
5. Your site will now be connected to your GitHub repository

Once connected, you can:
- Commit changes directly to your repository
- Trigger deployment workflows
- Monitor commit and deployment status

## Banner System

Temporal Flow features a versatile banner system that enhances visual storytelling through multiple banner types:

### Banner Types

- **Standard Animated Banner**: Auto-transitions between a series of images
- **Image Banner**: Displays a static featured image
- **Video Banner**: Embeds YouTube videos as page headers
- **Timeline Banner**: Creates interactive chronological visualizations

Banners automatically adapt to different screen sizes and can be customized through the admin panel's Appearance tab or in individual post frontmatter.

## Friend Content Sharing

The Friend Content Sharing system allows you to connect your blog with others running Temporal Flow, creating a decentralized network of content.

### Enabling Friend Sharing

For cross-domain functionality, you need to set up CORS headers. For GitHub Pages, add a `_headers` file to your repository root:
```
# Set CORS headers for the friend-content.json file
/friend-content.json
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

### Connecting With Friends

1. Log in to your blog as an administrator
2. Navigate to the `/friends` page
3. Enter your friend's blog name and URL
4. Click "Add Friend"

The Friend Content Sharing system is designed with privacy in mind - friend content is only visible to you when logged in, and your visitors only see your content.

## Timeline Visualization

Temporal Flow includes a powerful timeline visualization system that can display chronological events in multiple views.

### Adding Timeline Events

Any blog post can become a timeline event by adding timeline-specific frontmatter:

```yaml
---
timelineYear: 2025
timelineEra: "digital-age"
timelineLocation: "San Francisco"
isKeyEvent: false
---
```

The timeline can be fully configured through the admin panel, allowing you to create and manage different eras, set viewing options, and customize the appearance.

## Configuration

Temporal Flow can be configured through the admin panel or by directly editing configuration files:

- **Site Configuration**: Title, subtitle, language, theme settings
- **Navigation Configuration**: Navigation links, dropdown menus, external links
- **Timeline Configuration**: Timeline eras, display options, appearance settings
- **Community & About Pages**: Team profiles, contact information, community features

## Roadmap

Temporal Flow is under active development. Here's what we're working on:

### Coming Soon
- Enhanced media management in admin panel
- Post editor in the admin panel
- Extended banner animation options
- Enhanced friend content discovery

### Future Plans
