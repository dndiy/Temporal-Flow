# Configuration System Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to use the configuration system to edit your site settings.

## Initial Setup

First, ensure all Svelte components are properly installed in your project and your Astro page is set up correctly.

## Editing Site Information

### Step 1: Navigate to the Configuration Page

Go to your website's `/configs` URL. If you're not already authenticated, you'll see the login form:

```
Username: dndiy
Password: dndiy
```

### Step 2: Explore the General Tab

![General Tab]

The General tab allows you to edit:
- Site title and subtitle
- Language selection
- Table of Contents settings
- License information

For example, to change your site's title:
1. Locate the "Site Title" field
2. Change the value from "Greg Aster" to your preferred title
3. Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page

### Step 3: Customize Navigation Menu

Navigate to the "Navigation" tab to manage your site's navigation links:

1. Click "Add Link" to create a new navigation item
2. Choose between a "Preset Link" (predefined routes) or "Custom Link"
3. For a custom link, enter:
   - Link Name: "Portfolio"
   - URL: "/portfolio/"
   - External: No (leave unchecked)
4. Click "Add Link" to save

To add a dropdown menu to an existing link:
1. Find the link you want to edit
2. Click "Add Dropdown" at the bottom of the link card
3. Enter details for the dropdown item
4. Click "Add" to save the dropdown item

### Step 4: Edit Timeline Settings

The Timeline tab is particularly useful for your complex timeline configuration:

1. Navigate to the "Timeline" tab
2. Choose between "Eras" and "View Settings" sections
3. In the Eras section:
   - Click "Add Era" to create a new timeline era
   - Enter details including key, display name, year range, and visualization settings
   - Click "Create Era" to save
4. In the View Settings section:
   - Adjust zoom levels, thresholds, and other visualization parameters
   - Changes are applied immediately

### Step 5: Advanced Configuration

For direct editing of configuration files:

1. Navigate to the "Advanced" tab
2. Select the configuration type you want to edit (e.g., "Timeline")
3. Edit the JSON directly in the editor
4. Click "Apply Changes" to save

## Saving Configuration

When you click "Save Changes" at the bottom of any tab, the following happens:

1. Changes are stored in localStorage (in the demo version)
2. A success message appears briefly
3. In a production implementation, changes would be saved to your configuration files

## Common Tasks

### Adding a Social Media Link

1. Go to the "Profile" tab
2. Click "Add Social Link"
3. Select the platform (e.g., "Twitter")
4. The URL will be pre-filled with the platform's prefix
5. Complete your username/handle
6. Click "Add Link"

### Changing Theme Color

1. Navigate to the "Appearance" tab
2. Adjust the hue slider to select your desired color
3. See the preview update in real-time
4. For quick selection, click one of the color swatches
5. Toggle "Use fixed theme color" to control whether users can customize the theme

### Managing Favicons

1. In the "Appearance" tab, scroll to the Favicon section
2. Click "Add Favicon" to create a new favicon
3. Upload an image or enter the path manually
4. Select theme (light/dark/all) and size
5. Click "Add Favicon" to save

## Integrating with Your Components

The configuration values are available to your components after saving:

```javascript
// Example: Using the updated site title in a component
import { siteConfig } from '../config/config';

function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>{siteConfig.title}</h1>
      <p>{siteConfig.subtitle}</p>
    </header>
  );
}
```
