# About Temporal Flow

## A Platform for Digital Independence

Temporal Flow is built on a simple but powerful idea: **your content should belong to you**. In an age where most of our digital lives exist on platforms owned by corporations, Temporal Flow offers a different approach—a self-hosted, decentralized content platform that puts creators in control while still enabling meaningful connections.

## Core Philosophy

### Digital Ownership
Your content, your data, your audience—all under your control. Temporal Flow gives you the infrastructure without taking ownership of what you create.

### Decentralized Connections
Build relationships with other content creators directly, without algorithms or intermediaries deciding who sees what. Friend Content Sharing enables site-to-site connections that respect privacy and creator autonomy.

### Technology Independence
Since Temporal Flow runs on your own hosting, you're not vulnerable to platform policy changes, account suspensions, or sudden shutdowns. Your online presence remains stable and entirely yours.

### Content-First Design
We believe that good content should speak for itself. Temporal Flow's design puts your writing, images, and interactive elements front and center, with minimal distractions.

Temporal Flow is our contribution to that vision—a tool that helps creators establish their own corner of the internet while still belonging to a larger conversation.

Welcome to a different kind of content platform. Welcome to Temporal Flow.
