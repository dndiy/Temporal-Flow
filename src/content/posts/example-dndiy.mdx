## Site Overview

<div className="card-base p-6 mb-6">
  <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-400">dndiy.org</h3>
  
  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">DNDIY.org serves as the digital hub for Greg Aster, an experimental filmmaker and animator whose work blends surrealism, satire, and cultural commentary. The site functions as both portfolio and playground, showcasing Aster's projects while embodying his distinct aesthetic sensibilities.</p>
  
  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">The website's design balances accessibility with artistic expression, featuring an intuitive navigation system that guides visitors through Aster's body of work while maintaining visual intrigue through thoughtful typography, color usage, and interactive elements.</p>
  
  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">Perhaps most notably, dndiy.org doesn't just display creative work—it extends the creative experience through purposeful design choices that complement the content's themes and tones.</p>

  <p className="italic">Site Philosophy:</p>
  
  <blockquote className="mt-4 text-xl text-[oklch(0.35_0.05_var(--hue))] dark:text-[oklch(0.85_0.05_var(--hue))]">
    "DNDIY stands for 'Do Not Do It Yourself'—an ironic statement from someone who primarily works solo. The name encapsulates the tension between independent creation and collaborative possibility, acknowledging that even the most personal projects draw from collective cultural contexts."
  </blockquote>
</div>

## Featured Projects

The site showcases several of Aster's distinctive projects, each presented with immersive documentation that extends beyond simple video embeds to include process materials, explanatory text, and contextual information.
